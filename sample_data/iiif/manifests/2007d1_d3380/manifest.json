  "description": "The Duveen Brothers was a firm of influential art dealers from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century based in London, Paris, and New York. With Joseph Duveen (1869-1939) at the helm and the assistance of art experts, most notably Bernard Berenson (1865-1959), Duveen Brothers played a prominent role in the transfer of old master paintings, antique furnishings, and objets d'art from Europe to the United States. Series X includes papers relating to Lord Joseph Duveen: clippings, photographs, and correspondence which sheds light on Joseph Duveen's philanthropy and relationships with artists. Included are photographs of paintings and sculptures of Lord Duveen, and photographs of Duveen's relatives, friends and personnel. There are drawings related to the Tate Gallery, London, additions  sponsored by Joseph Joel Duveen and later by his son, as well as photographs of the Elgin Marbles room of the British Museum,  donated by Duveen, and other benefactions to art in Britain and the United States.",
