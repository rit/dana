    "description": "Series V comprises Szeemann's audiovisual collection, which features over 2240 items including short films, videos, radio and television interviews and reports, music, photographic and textual files, and museum and gallery ephemera. Materials consist primarily of VHS and other formats of videotape, audio discs in the form of CDs and vinyl records, videodiscs (DVDs), audiocassettes, and computer discs in the form of CD-ROMs, CD-Rs, and floppy disks; the collection also includes 16mm and 8mm films, audiotape reels, and video compact discs (VCDs). Series V.A contains materials originally housed in Series I. Project files, and those whose titles or other means of identification link the item to a particular exhibition or project. Series V.B contains materials originally housed with the artist files in Series II as well as items created by artists not already listed in that series. In the latter case, the name of the director, conductor, or other entity identified as the work's main creator, where available, has been used to file the item. Also of interest are some of the items' original containers, many of which contain text or artwork pertaining to the item, and some of which are artworks in themselves; examples include those of Eva and Adele, Friederike Pezold, Anna Jermolaewa; and Jean Roualdes. While many of the sticky notes found attached to items contain brief notes regarding computer compatibility or whether contents have been printed, others feature pithy or even extensive annotations that provide a glimpse into the curatorial process; some examples are notes that accompany the work of Hermann J. Kassell, Ene-Liis Semper, Ann-Sofi-Sid\u00e9n, and Peter Land. Series V.C contains audiovisual items originally housed in Series III. Curator and museum professional files. Series V.D contains audiovisual items originally housed in Series VI. Topical files as well as materials deemed by the archivist to be related to particular topics. Series V.E contains audiovisual items originally housed in Series VII. Gallery and museum ephemera and unfiled items from galleries and museums. Series V.F contains items that appear to be of a personal nature. Series V.G contains unidentified items, including audiocassettes, audio and videodiscs, audiotape reels, and films and film scraps with either no information or with information inadequate for classification.",
