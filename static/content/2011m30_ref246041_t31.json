    "description": "Szeemann's hard drive contains 8.8 gigabytes of digital content. The drive is a Maxtor DiamondMax\u00ae Plus 9, 60GB. Szeemann's computer had a Windows operating system and Microsoft Outlook as the email client.  The emails are PST files from Outlook. Other files are mostly JPG, BMP, PDF, TIF, HTM, and Microsoft Word files primarily relating to artists and exhibitions. The file names are in Italian and German. Many of the digital files, including email, were printed out by Szeemann or his staff and are duplicated in the archive's paper files.   Access copies of the digital files are accessible on a laptop in the Special Collections Reading Room. All files except emails are available as a mounted disk image in a Windows environment. The emails are on the laptop as imported PST files and are accessible using a Microsoft Outlook client. Files containing restricted personal information such as third-party bank account numbers or student records have been removed from the access copy and may be accessed when the restriction period ends in 2081. The series is contained in two boxes (2 linear feet). ",
